# Massive Growth:

NVIDIA's revenue over the past year has skyrocketed to $113.27 billion, and its operating profit (EBIT) has hit an impressive $71.03 billion. This shows the company is not just growing but doing so profitably.

# Efficient Business Model:

A big chunk of NVIDIA's revenue turns into profit, proving that its business is highly scalable and efficient.

# Beating Expectations:

NVIDIA consistently outperforms what analysts predict, with its most recent earnings beating estimates by 6.45%, even in tough market conditions.

Right now, NVIDIA’s Forward P/E is at 33.1x, which is below its historical average of 39.4x. This means the stock is trading at a cheaper valuation compared to what investors have been willing to pay for it in the past.

What’s Happening? NVIDIA’s P/E was sky-high at 71.0x in 2021 during the tech boom but dropped to 19.6x in 2022 as markets corrected. Now, it’s settled at a level that reflects optimism about its growth, but without being overhyped.

This lower valuation could be a great opportunity for long-term investors who believe in NVIDIA’s future, especially as it continues to dominate AI, gaming, and advanced computing.

Shares peaked in 2022: NVIDIA was issuing more shares, likely to raise funds or as part of employee stock programs.

Decline since 2022: The company has been buying back shares, reducing the total to 24.49 billion, which helps boost the value of each share and improves earnings per share (EPS).

The reduction in shares signals NVIDIA’s focus on rewarding long-term investors and confidence in its future performance.

Current EBIT (LTM): NVIDIA’s operating profit over the past year hit $71.03 billion, showing strong performance.

Future Projections: Analysts expect EBIT to grow significantly, reaching $163.66 billion by 2027, driven by demand for AI and GPUs.

NVIDIA’s profitability is growing fast, and analysts are confident in its future. For long-term investors, it’s a solid bet on cutting-edge tech and sustained growth.

NVIDIA’s financials show a strong rebound and massive growth potential:

Net Income: After a dip in 2022, NVIDIA’s adjusted net income surged +286% YoY in 2023 and is projected to grow to $109.7B in 2025 and $141.5B in 2027.

Margins: Profit margins improve significantly, reaching 57.55% by 2027, showcasing efficiency and pricing power.

EPS Growth: Earnings per share are expected to rise steadily, from $2.95 in 2024 to $6.10 by 2028.
